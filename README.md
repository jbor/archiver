# archiver

This is a Powershell archiver script. It can be configured with several parameters such as timespan, retention, include and exclude arrays. 

It uses a configuration XML file which can be created/configured manually, or by using the ArchiverUI tool, which a simple Visual Basic C# forms project.

It's very useable for archiving (large) folders in batch.
